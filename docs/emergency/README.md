## Home Automation

Hi there. If you're reading this then I have inflicted a home automation system upon you. I apologise for that deeply.

### Important links

- Home Assistant - the central place to control lighting and automations
- Zigbee2MQTT-core - controls the main Zigbee devices scattered around the apartment
- Zigbee2MQTT-aqara - controls the Aqara Zigbee devices scattered around the apartment
- ESPhome - controls the custom devices scattered around the apartment.

### Situation

The shit has hit the fan.

- The home automation has stopped working (lighting, heating, etc).
- An individual home automation device will not work (a single light, or switch).

## Home Network

The home network, including wifi and the connection to the Internet.

### Important links

- I cannot connect to the wifi.
- I can connect to the wifi, but the connection to the internet is down.
- The home media app isn't working.
