# Hardware setup

The [Ansible Inventory](ansible/inventory/hosts.yaml) describes everything that lives on this network.

I try to put everything into baremetal racks, because, well, it's fun, isn't it? Rip those machines out of any cases they might live in, like tortoises being ripped from their shells, and link them together on their own switch and subnet. Turn off any unnecessary gubbins.
