# Carrier Grade NAT

It turns out that my ISP 1&1 run most of their residential customers behind carrier grade NAT. Which means that I don't have even a dynamic IP4 address onto the public internet, but instead share a single IP with 3000 other anxious Germans. 

This explains why my attempts to dial into my DDNSed personal domain. 

[There's a workaround](https://hacdias.com/2020/11/30/access-network-behind-cgnat) but it's annoying and involves using a VPS.
