# Wireguard

Just got [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com) working using [a third-party Anisble role](https://github.com/githubixx/ansible-role-wireguard).

Setting up a mobile client now by [generating a QR code that contains the setup for a mobile device](https://serversideup.net/generating-wireguard-qr-codes-for-fast-mobile-deployments/).
