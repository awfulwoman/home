# ZFS Backup - Client 

This role is used on hosts that require ZFS backups. It installs Sanoid, and initiates regular snapshots of the ZFS filesystem. It then ensures that a ZFS user is installed that allows access via the backup server (via SSH) that will then command the client to send ZFS datasets to the backup server. This is a pull strategy rather than a push strategy, ensuring that the clien itself never has access to the backup server, prevent island hopping attacks.
