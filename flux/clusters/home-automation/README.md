# Home Automation Cluster

This cluster is going to be focussed solely on home automation, and nothing else. 

Why? It's dealing with stuff in my home. I don't want to be dealing with outages or *my lights suddenly not working*. Screw that. It's gonna be rock-solid, with no experiments, no bleeding edges, and no getting glared at by my partner.

It runs on dedicated bare-metal: 4 physical Raspberry Pi 4 machines, so no hypervisor layers. If one Pi dies, there's another to take over the load.
