# At Home With The GitOps

My home GitOps setup. Configuration as Code FTW.

* Hardware inventory management: handled by Ansible 
* Pretty much everything else: handled by Flux and Kubernetes.

I started out writing this as a series of notes but it's growing into a mini-opera with weird sentence structures and constantly switching audiences.

## HUMAN EMOTION: PLEASE LEAVE IF YOU ARE TOO TECHY

This is all part of a huge learning and emotional experience for me. I spent a lot of 2020 and 2021 in hospital, dealing with a lot of medical shit. When I got out my brain decided that I needed to make some changes to my life. So one of those things was to make a gigantic and ill-planned career change from Frontend Development (and tbh mostly being a manager and therefore mostly a spreadsheet pilot) to infrastructure & Platform Engineering as *an actual engineer and not a maanger*.

Part of skilling up in this new role has been doing some stuff on the side. This is one of those things. Also I am coming to accept that I'm a massive nerd and that I'm allowed to play with this shit.

So if you see mistakes in this repo it's because I'm new at all this. But on the brifht side I think I'm coming into this strong: I'm massively ADHD and a junior-grade space cadet my brain tens to work well at fitting things together and thinking in terms of systems, so I think I'm pretty suited for this kind thing.

BUT ENOUGH CHAT. MORE CODE.
